<h1>Warm Ups</h1>
<p>
<p>I think my ideal web dev job would be working for myself, probably doing something like creating mobile apps. I've a
    few ideas of things I'd like to see and I think being able to make those happen instead of always saying "Man, it
    would be cool if someone made a [blank] app" would be great. I'm not adverse to the idea of working in a company or
    alongside others in a team or so, but the idea of being able to guide my own direction sounds nice, and ultimately
    I'd like to take what I learn here and apply it towards something like that.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure at this point what all that would entail, I've worked in such a wide range of jobs and
    environments and the ones that offered me the most opportunity for self-sufficiency stood out to me the most and,
    though it was the most daunting, it felt good nonetheless to be able to experience that kind of control over the
    work.</p>
<p>SMART Goal:
<ul>
    <li>Specific: I want to create a mobile app that I can put up in mobile app stores</li>
    <li>Measurable: I am able to track my progress in this class and the knowledge gained that is necessary to reach my
        objective
    </li>
    <li>Achievable: This is something I can see becoming a reality, and a milestone that can lead to further goals.</li>
    <li>Relevant: Success in this class is directly related to my goals and ambitions following this first milestone and
        the growth I intend to make after and beyond.
    </li>
    <li>Time-Bound: I would like to see myself accomplish this before the end of next-year, more specifically be
        achieved by my Birthday.
    </li>
</ul>
